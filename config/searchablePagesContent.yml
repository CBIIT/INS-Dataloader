  title: "About the Index of NCI Studies (INS)"
  content:
    - paragraph: "Key Takeaways"
    - paragraph: "The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Index of NCI Studies (INS) compiles and shares information about research outputs produced by NCI-supported programs."
    - paragraph: "The INS is continuing to evolve and is not yet comprehensive. Additional programs and output types will be added periodically."
    - paragraph: "The INS incorporates information from NIH RePORTER, NIH iCite, and NCBI PubMed along with curated inputs."
    - paragraph: "INS OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE"
    - paragraph: "The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is pleased to release the next phase of the Index of NCI Studies (INS) to tackle the challenge of assembling NCI program information from publicly available resources. Building connections between NCI programs, projects, grants, and research outputs is a complex task typically addressed through manual curation by portfolio analysis experts. Due to the challenging nature of curating this information, the INS is not comprehensive - additional information will be added in an iterative fashion. For detailed documentation about the information within INS, please see our open-source INS Data Gathering GitHub repository."
    - paragraph: "We look forward to hearing your feedback at nciofficeofdatasharing@mail.nih.gov."
    - paragraph: "Programs: NCI Programs are curated for use within INS by the NCI’s Office of Data Sharing and represent collections of scientific research projects and support that serve as hubs for scientific discovery. Programs are associated with Focus Area groupings (such as Pediatric or Cancer MoonshotSM) as well as known sources of NCI funding (such as specific awards or Notices of Funding Opportunities). Programs may support multiple projects and their downstream efforts. Not all NCI-supported programs are included in the current release of INS. Curation is ongoing; additional programs will be added, and existing program information will be updated in the future."
    - paragraph: "Grants & Projects: NCI-supported projects represent a focused scientific study or effort. Projects are groupings of grants, which represent yearly support and supplements. The INS primarily consists of extramural grants, but also includes some projects supported by contracts. The INS does not currently include intramural awards. Only grants and projects that received NCI funding during or after year 2000 are included in the INS. The curation of grants and projects is automated using resources from the NIH RePORTER."
    - paragraph: "Publications: The INS includes publications associated with NCI-supported projects. Only publications published during or after year 2000 and available on NCBI PubMed are included within the INS, and many publications are associated with more than one project. The curation of publications and their association with projects is automated using resources from the NIH RePORTER, NCBI PubMed, and NIH iCite. For more information about how publications are associated with projects, please see the NIH RePORTER FAQ."
    - paragraph: "SITE FUNCTIONALITY"
    - paragraph: "Home Page"
    - paragraph: "Provides an overview of the site, a snapshot of the number of programs, projects, grants, and publications along with links to other site pages."
    - paragraph: "Explore Page"
    - paragraph: "Provides access to all information within INS. Tabs for Programs, Projects, Grants, and Publications each show summary information and provide links to other resources where appropriate. Filters applied on the left will change the information displayed in all tabs and plots accordingly."
    - paragraph: "About Page"
    - paragraph: "Describes the objectives and scope of the INS, its data gathering process, and the site’s functionality."
    - paragraph: "CONTACT INS"
